# Design ATM
>  **Requirements:-**
> - We can only withdrawal money of note 500,100 and 50.
> - Amount should be multiple of 50, otherwise show error message.
> - Type of note will be withdrawal based on the amount that we wish to withdrawal, for example if we want to withdrawal 750 rupees than the notes which should withdrwal are:
>> - 500*1=500 (one 500 rupee note).
>> - 100*2=200 (two 100 rupee note).
>> - 50*1=50 (one 50 rupee note).
> - Follow oops, solid principles, design patterns wherever required.

> **My Approach:-**
> - Use chain of responsibility design pattern.
